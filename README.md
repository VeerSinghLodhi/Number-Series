Number Series and Special Numbers
ArmStrongNumber:
A program to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

Description: An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.
Example: 153 = 

EvenOrOdd:
A program to determine whether a given number is even or odd.

Description: Uses the modulus operator (%) to check divisibility by 2.
FactorialProgram:
A program to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Description: Factorial of 
ùëõ
n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 
ùëõ
n.
Example: 
5!
=
5

120
5!=5√ó4√ó3√ó2√ó1=120.
PalindromeNumber:
A program to check whether a given number is a palindrome.

Description: A palindrome number is one that reads the same backward as forward.
Example: 121, 12321.
PalindromeString:
A program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

Description: A palindrome string reads the same backward as forward.
Example: "madam", "level".
PrimeNumberOrNot:
A program to determine whether a number is a prime number.

Description: A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
Example: 2, 3, 5, 7.
ReverseInteger:
A program to reverse the digits of an integer.

Description: Takes a number as input and reverses its digits.
Example: 123 becomes 321.
ReverseString:
A program to reverse a given string.

Description: Takes a string input and outputs its reverse.
Example: "hello" becomes "olleh".
SpecialNumber:
A program to check for special numbers (e.g., magic numbers).

Description: A special number depends on a unique condition, such as the sum of digits repeatedly adding to 1.
Example: 19 ‚Üí 

1+9=10‚Üí1+0=1 (magic number).
StrongNumber:
A program to check whether a number is a Strong number.

Description: A Strong number is a number where the sum of the factorial of its digits equals the number itself.
Example: 145 = 
1!
+
4!
+
5!
=
145
1!+4!+5!=145.
