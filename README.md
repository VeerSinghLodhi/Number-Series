# Number Series Programs in Java

This repository contains a collection of Java programs focused on solving number and string-related problems. Below is a brief description of each program:

## Files and Descriptions

1. **ArmStrongNumber.java**  
   This program checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number.  
   *Example:* 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **EvenOrOdd.java**  
   A simple program to determine if a given number is even or odd.

3. **FactorialProgram.java**  
   Computes the factorial of a given number using an iterative or recursive approach.  
   *Example:* Factorial of 5 is \(5! = 120\).

4. **PalindromeNumber.java**  
   Checks if a given number is a palindrome.  
   *Example:* 121 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.

5. **PalindromeString.java**  
   Verifies if a given string is a palindrome.  
   *Example:* "madam" is a palindrome.

6. **PrimeNumberorNot.java**  
   Determines if a given number is a prime number.  
   *Example:* 7 is a prime number as it is divisible only by 1 and itself.

7. **ReverseInteger.java**  
   Reverses the digits of an integer.  
   *Example:* 123 becomes 321.

8. **ReverseString.java**  
   Reverses the characters of a string.  
   *Example:* "hello" becomes "olleh".

9. **SpecialNumber.java**  
   Checks if a given number is a special number based on specific criteria.  
   *Example:* (Custom logic to be detailed in the program.)

10. **StrongNumber.java**  
    Determines if a number is a Strong number. A Strong number is a number where the sum of the factorials of its digits equals the number itself.  
    *Example:* 145 is a Strong number because \(1! + 4! + 5! = 145\).
